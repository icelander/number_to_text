# Numbers to Text

## Overview

This fulfills a pretty simple requirement: Take a number like 1,234 and output it in a string like "one thousand two hundred and thirty-four." Works for numbers up to 999,999,999,999,999,999,999 and can be customized for whatever language you like and even different names for other large numbers. Especially useful when you're sending information to a speech synthesizer.

## Usage

1. include the file in your project
2. Call the function like this: `numbers_to_text(1234)`
3. Enjoy outputting information in a moderately less human-readable format
